#I wanted to create a small program that is interacting with the body, you can click anywhere on the body and shows you the name and definition as well as what it does. This is something I thought would be interesting because I am pre-OT, I am very interested in the body.
#My first function will be responsible for creating and showing a 3D model of the human body. It will allow people to iteract with it by zooming in, rotating, and clicking different parts of the body. 
##My second function will allow users to click specific parts and it will read out the definition of the body part you clicked on. If you clicked on the heart it would would read the heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system. 
##The last function will be able to detect which part of the body the person is clicking on. This will trigger the definition to appear when you click on the body part you want.
